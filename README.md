# InfraKit.AWS

[InfraKit](https://github.com/docker/infrakit) plugins for creating and managing resources in Amazon AWS.

## Instance plugin

An InfraKit instance plugin is provided, creates Amazon EC2 instances.

### Building and running

To build the AWS Instance plugin, run `make binaries`.  The plugin binary will be located at
`./bin/infrakit-instance-aws`.

### Plugin properties

The plugin expects properties in the following format:
```json
{
  "Tags": {
  },
  "RunInstancesInput": {
  }
}
```

The `Tags` property is a string-string mapping of EC2 instance tags to include on all instances that are created.
`RunInstancesInput` follows the structure of the type by the same name in the
[AWS go SDK](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/ec2/#RunInstancesInput).


#### AWS API Credentials

The plugin can use API credentials from several sources.
- config file: See [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-environment)
- EC2 instance metadata See [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html)

Additional credentials sources are supported, but are not generally recommended as they are less secure:
- command line arguments: `--session-token`, or  `--access-key-id` and `--secret-access-key`
- environment variables: See [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-environment)
